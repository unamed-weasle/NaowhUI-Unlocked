# What is this?
I forked the original project and modified it to remove the paywall.
I'm not sure how long I'll maintain it. Maybe a couple of weeks into Midnight, maybe forever. Hopefully this foolish paywall practice ends soon.

# How to install the addon?
1. Click on the green "Code" button
2. Click on "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the downloaded file
4. Rename the folder with all the addon files to "NaowhUI"
5. Copy this folder into your Addon folder
6. Edit the file "NaowhUI.toc" and change `[Game]` to one of the following (on the last line):
  - Retail => Standard
  - Burning Crusade => TBC
  - Vanilla => Vanilla
  - Mist of Pandaria => Mists

  So the line should look something like this:
  `Game\Standard\!load.xml`
