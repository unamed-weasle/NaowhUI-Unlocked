# What is this?
I forked the original project and modified it to remove the paywall.
I'm not sure how long I'll maintain it. Maybe a couple of weeks into Midnight, maybe forever. Hopefully this foolish paywall practice ends soon.

# How to install the addon?
1. Download NaowhUI from Curseforge (this will ensure all dependencies are included)
2. Click on the green "Code" button in this project
3. Click on "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the downloaded file
5. Copay all the downloaded files to the NaowhUI addon folder
6. Overwrite everyfile
